## Phase 3: Information Gain Calculation & Action Selection ✅

**Completed**: 2025-10-04
**Model Used**: Claude Opus 4.1
**Duration**: 1 session

### Implementation Summary

Enhanced `InformationGainLearner` class with information-theoretic action selection:

1. **Applicability Probability Calculation** (`_calculate_applicability_probability`):
   - Uses SAT model counting on CNF formulas
   - Returns 1.0 for actions with no constraints
   - Calculates P(applicable) = |SAT(cnf with state)| / |SAT(cnf)|
   - Handles empty CNF formulas and contradictions

2. **Entropy & Information Gain Methods**:
   - `_calculate_entropy(action)`: Measures uncertainty in action model
   - `_calculate_potential_gain_success(action, objects, state)`: Information from success
   - `_calculate_potential_gain_failure(action, objects, state)`: Information from failure
   - `_calculate_expected_information_gain(action, objects, state)`: E[gain] = P(success)*gain_success + P(failure)*gain_failure

3. **Action Selection Strategies** (`select_action` & `_select_by_strategy`):
   - **Greedy**: Always selects action with maximum expected gain
   - **Epsilon-greedy**: Explores with probability ε (default 0.1)
   - **Boltzmann**: Probabilistic selection using softmax with temperature parameter
   - Replaced placeholder with full implementation

4. **Key Features**:
   - Handles edge cases (empty state, no constraints, all gains zero)
   - Numerical stability in softmax calculation
   - Efficient CNF formula copying for state constraints
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Test Suite Updates

- `TestActionSelection`: 5 tests for selection strategies
- `TestConvergenceImprovement`: Meta-tests for convergence
- Enhanced `TestIntegration`: Full learning cycle with info gain

**Total Tests**: ~60 tests (Phase 1-3 combined)

### Key Achievements

## Phase 2: CNF Formula Management & Update Rules ✅

**Completed**: 2025-09-30
**Model Used**: Sonnet 4.5
**Duration**: 1 session

### Implementation Summary

[Previous Phase 2 content remains unchanged...]

## Phase 1: Core Data Structures & State Management ✅

**Completed**: 2025-09-30
**Model Used**: Sonnet 4.5
**Duration**: 1 session

### Implementation Summary

Created `InformationGainLearner` class (`src/algorithms/information_gain.py`) with:

1. **Action Model State Variables** (per action schema):
   - `pre`: Possible preconditions (not ruled out) - initialized to La
   - `pre_constraints`: Constraint sets (pre?) - initialized to empty list
   - `eff_add`: Confirmed add effects - initialized to empty set
   - `eff_del`: Confirmed delete effects - initialized to empty set
   - `eff_maybe_add`: Possible add effects - initialized to La
   - `eff_maybe_del`: Possible delete effects - initialized to La

2. **Binding Functions**:
   - `bindP_inverse(literals, objects)`: Grounds lifted literals with concrete objects
     - Example: `on(?x,?y)` with `[a,b]` → `on_a_b`
     - Handles negative literals: `¬on(?x,?y)` → `¬on_a_b`
   - `bindP(fluents, objects)`: Lifts grounded fluents to parameter-bound literals
     - Example: `on_a_b` with `[a,b]` → `on(?x,?y)`
     - Handles negative fluents: `¬on_a_b` → `¬on(?x,?y)`

3. **La Generation** (`_get_parameter_bound_literals`):
   - Generates all parameter-bound literals for each action
   - Includes both positive and negative literals
   - Uses standard parameter naming: ?x, ?y, ?z, etc.
   - Leverages PDDL handler's infrastructure (no type checking reimplementation)

4. **Observation Recording**:
   - Records all observations in `observation_history`
   - Tracks action name, objects, success/failure, states
   - Update logic placeholder for Phase 2

### Test Suite

**File**: `tests/test_information_gain.py`
**Coverage**: 25 tests (24 passing, 1 skipped for Phase 2)

Test classes:
- `TestInitialization`: State variable initialization
- `TestParameterBoundLiterals`: La generation correctness
- `TestBindingFunctions`: bindP and bindP_inverse correctness
- `TestObservationRecording`: Observation tracking
- `TestLearnedModelExport`: Model export structure
- `TestReset`: Reset functionality
- `TestConvergence`: Convergence detection
- `TestIntegration`: End-to-end cycles

**Key Test Feature**: `calculate_La_independently()` helper function provides ground truth for La validation, ensuring tests don't depend on implementation internals.

### Design Decisions

1. **¬ Symbol for Negation**: Used as internal representation following algorithm notation. Phase 2 will handle PDDL conversion.

2. **Type Checking Avoided**: Leveraged existing PDDL infrastructure instead of reimplementing type compatibility logic.

3. **Simple Parameter Naming**: Standard ?x, ?y, ?z convention for lifted literals.

4. **Placeholder Methods**: `select_action()` and `observe()` are placeholders for later phases.

### Key Learnings

- **Test Independence**: Independent La calculation ensures tests validate correctness, not just consistency.
- **Infrastructure Reuse**: Using PDDLHandler avoided complex type hierarchy logic.
- **Negation Representation**: Internal ¬ symbol keeps algorithm logic clean, with conversion at boundaries.

### Files Created/Modified

**Created**:
- `src/algorithms/information_gain.py` (442 lines)
- `tests/test_information_gain.py` (395 lines)

**Integration**: All existing tests pass (`make test`), no regressions.

### Phase 1 Success Criteria ✅

- [x] All state variables properly initialized
- [x] Binding functions work with lifted fluents
- [x] Test coverage > 90%
- [x] Independent La calculation validates correctness
- [x] No regressions in existing tests

## Phase 2: CNF Formula Construction & Update Rules ✅

**Completed**: 2025-10-04
**Model Used**: Opus 4.1
**Duration**: 1 session (implemented after Phase 1)

### Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented CNF formula construction and observation update rules in `InformationGainLearner`:

1. **CNF Manager Integration**:
   - Integrated `CNFManager` from `src/core/cnf_manager.py`
   - Each action has its own CNF manager instance
   - Formulas built from constraint sets dynamically

2. **Success Update Rules Implemented** (`_update_success()`):
   - Precondition narrowing: `pre(a) = pre(a) ∩ bindP(s, O)`
   - Confirmed add effects: `eff+(a) = eff+(a) ∪ bindP(s' \ s, O)`
   - Confirmed delete effects: `eff-(a) = eff-(a) ∪ bindP(s \ s', O)`
   - Possible add effects: `eff?+(a) = eff?+(a) ∩ bindP(s ∩ s', O)`
   - Possible delete effects: `eff?-(a) = eff?-(a) \ bindP(s ∪ s', O)`
   - Constraint updates: `pre?(a) = {B ∩ bindP(s, O) | B ∈ pre?(a)}`

3. **Failure Update Rules Implemented** (`_update_failure()`):
   - Constraint addition: `pre?(a) = pre?(a) ∪ {pre(a) \ bindP(s, O)}`
   - Correctly accumulates constraints over multiple failures

4. **CNF Construction** (`_build_cnf_formula()`):
   - Builds CNF formula: `cnf_pre?(a) = ⋀(⋁xl) for B ∈ pre?(a), l ∈ B`
   - Each constraint set becomes a clause (disjunction)
   - Handles both positive and negative literals
   - Proper conversion between internal ¬ notation and CNF format

5. **State Format Conversion**:
   - `_state_to_internal()`: Converts UP/set format to internal representation
   - `_internal_to_pddl()`: Converts internal ¬ to PDDL `(not ...)` format
   - Maintains semantic equivalence across formats

### Test Coverage

**File**: `tests/test_information_gain.py`
**Coverage**: 38 tests (100% pass rate)

New test classes added for Phase 2:
- `TestUpdateRules`: 8 tests validating all update rules
  - Precondition narrowing on success
  - Effect learning (add/delete)
  - eff_maybe set separation
  - Constraint accumulation on failure
  - Negative precondition handling
  - State conversion functions

- `TestCNFIntegrationWithAlgorithm`: 2 tests
  - CNF reflects learned precondition certainty
  - Internal negation format consistency

### Key Achievements

1. **Mathematical Correctness**: All update rules precisely match algorithm specification
2. **Negative Precondition Support**: Properly handles ¬ literals in CNF clauses
3. **Test Validation**: Previously skipped test `test_eff_maybe_sets_become_disjoint_after_success` now passes
4. **Format Conversions**: Clean boundary between internal ¬ notation and PDDL/CNF formats
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing CNFManager infrastructure

### Design Decisions

1. **Clear CNF on Rebuild**: Fresh CNF formula built each time from constraints
2. **Lazy CNF Construction**: Formula only built when needed, not after every update
3. **Consistent Negation**: Internal ¬ symbol maintained, conversion at boundaries
4. **Constraint Set Filtering**: Empty constraints removed, unmodified constraints preserved

### Files Modified

**Modified**:
- `src/algorithms/information_gain.py` (added ~400 lines for update rules and CNF)
- `tests/test_information_gain.py` (added ~300 lines for new test classes)

### Phase 2 Success Criteria ✅

- [x] Negative preconditions properly handled in CNF
- [x] All update rules match algorithm specification
- [x] Test `test_eff_maybe_sets_become_disjoint_after_success` passes
