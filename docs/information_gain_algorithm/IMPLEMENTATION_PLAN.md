# Information Gain Algorithm Implementation Plan

## üéØ Document Purpose
A phase-based implementation guide for the CNF-based Information-Theoretic action model learning algorithm. Each phase includes specific tasks, model recommendations, initialization prompts, and success criteria.

## üìç Document Maintenance Protocol
**CRITICAL**: This document maintains ONLY current phase information. When a phase is completed:
1. Archive completed phase details to `COMPLETED_PHASES.md` in same directory
2. Update initialization prompt with phase completion summary
3. Remove outdated implementation details
4. Keep only relevant context for next phase

## üìä Overall Progress

| Phase | Status | Duration |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1: Core Data Structures | ‚úÖ Complete | 1 session |
| Phase 2: CNF & Update Rules | ‚úÖ Complete | 1 session |
| Phase 3: Information Gain | ‚úÖ Complete | 1 session |
| Phase 4: Integration & Testing | üîµ Current | 2-3 sessions |
| Phase 5: Performance | ‚è≥ Pending | 2 sessions |
| Phase 6: Comparative Analysis | ‚è≥ Pending | 1-2 sessions |

## üîµ Current Phase: Phase 4 - Integration & Testing

**Model**: Sonnet 4.5 (integration and testing focus)
**Duration**: 2-3 sessions
**Previous Phases**: Phase 1-3 complete - Full information gain algorithm implemented

### Phase 3 Completion Summary

**What was completed**:
- ‚úÖ Applicability probability calculation using SAT model counting
- ‚úÖ Entropy calculation for action model uncertainty
- ‚úÖ Potential information gain from success/failure
- ‚úÖ Expected information gain calculation
- ‚úÖ Three action selection strategies (greedy, epsilon-greedy, Boltzmann)
- ‚úÖ Replaced placeholder select_action() with full implementation
- ‚úÖ ~60 total tests across all phases

**Key achievements**:
- Information gain correctly drives action selection
- Handles edge cases (empty state, no constraints, zero gains)
- Numerical stability in probability calculations
- Main test suite still passes (51 tests)

**Ready for Phase 4**:
- Full algorithm implementation complete
- Ready for integration with experiment runner
- Can be compared against OLAM and other baselines

### Phase 4 Tasks

#### 1. Integration with Experiment Runner

#### 2. Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Test on multiple domains (blocksworld, gripper, rover, depots)
- [ ] Validate convergence behavior
- [ ] Compare against random baseline
- [ ] Stress test with large state spaces

#### 3. Performance Profiling
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks in SAT counting
- [ ] Measure time per action selection
- [ ] Profile memory usage
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

#### 4. Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Create comparison with OLAM

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Algorithm runs in experiment framework

- @tests/ (existing test structure)

Tasks:
1. Integrate with experiment runner
2. Test on multiple domains
3. Profile performance

## üö´ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Algorithm Understanding
1. **State Format Confusion**: Always verify UP vs internal format conversions
2. **Negative Literal Handling**: ¬¨p means p ‚àâ state, not a negated fluent
3. **Binding Semantics**: bindP and bindP_inverse have specific mathematical definitions

### Implementation Details
4. **CNF Variable Mapping**: Maintain consistent fluent‚Üívariable mapping
5. **Lifted vs Grounded**: Use proper binding functions for conversions
6. **Set Operations**: Python set difference operator: `\` not `/`

### Testing Practices
7. **Test Independence**: Each test must be isolated, no shared state
8. **Domain Compatibility**: Test with both simple (drive) and complex (lift) actions
9. **Convergence Validation**: Verify algorithm converges correctly

## üìù Progress Tracking Protocol

After each session:
1. Run `make test` to ensure no regressions
2. execute the file maintenance protocol at the start of this file
3. Document any blockers or design decisions
