# Information Gain Algorithm Bug Fix

## Issue Identified
The Information Gain algorithm was not learning from observations, as revealed by validation experiment (commit 7713a30):
- No CNF clauses were being built (0 clauses throughout)
- Hypothesis space never reduced (stayed at 2,099,200)
- No effects learned (F1=0.00 for all effects)
- Information gain stayed constant (1.500)
- Algorithm kept selecting the same failing action 100 times

## Root Cause
The `observe()` method was only recording observations but never processing them. The `update_model()` method contains the actual learning logic but was never called.

## Fix Applied
1. Modified `InformationGainLearner.observe()` to automatically call `update_model()` after recording each observation
2. This ensures the model learns immediately from each observation
3. Updated documentation to reflect the new behavior

## Files Modified
- `src/algorithms/information_gain.py` - Added auto-call to update_model() at end of observe()
- `scripts/validate_information_gain.py` - Updated comment (update_model now called automatically)
- `tests/algorithms/test_information_gain_observation.py` - Added comprehensive unit tests

## Results After Fix
Validation Score improved from 1/4 to 2/4 behaviors confirmed:
- ✓ Hypothesis space reduction: Successfully reduces by 100%
- ✓ Information gain-based selection: Working correctly
- ✗ Model entropy decrease: Entropy calculation needs separate fix
- ⚠ Ground truth convergence: F1=0.68 (improved from 0.07, but needs more successful actions)

## Key Improvements
- CNF clauses are now built from observations
- Hypothesis space reduces as expected
- Information gain values change as model learns
- Model accuracy improved from F1=0.07 to F1=0.68

## Remaining Issues
1. Entropy calculation formula incorrect (line 307 in information_gain.py)
2. Need more successful actions for better effect learning (current test only has failures)
3. Target F1 score of 0.8 not yet achieved

## Testing
All new unit tests pass:
- `test_failure_creates_cnf_clauses` ✓
- `test_hypothesis_space_reduction` ✓
- `test_effect_learning_from_success` ✓
- `test_precondition_reduction` ✓
- `test_information_gain_changes_after_observation` ✓

## Next Steps
1. Fix entropy calculation to use CNF hypothesis space
2. Run longer experiments with more successful actions
3. Tune convergence parameters for better accuracy
