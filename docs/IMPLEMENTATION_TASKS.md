# Implementation Tasks for Online Model Learning Framework

## Project Overview
Building an experiment framework to compare three online action model learning algorithms:
1. **OLAM** - Baseline (Python implementation)
2. **ModelLearner** - Optimistic Exploration (Python implementation)
3. **Information-Theoretic** - Novel CNF-based approach with SAT solving

## 🎯 Quick Start for New Session

**For next agent starting fresh:**
1. Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` first (mandatory)
2. Check `CLAUDE.md` for navigation help
3. Start with Phase 2: Information-Theoretic Algorithm
4. Use existing CNFManager and PDDLHandler - they're complete!

## 📝 MANDATORY UPDATE RULE

**After completing ANY implementation task:**
1. **Update this file** (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md`) to reflect:
   - What was implemented (move to ✅ Completed)
   - Any new insights or changes needed for remaining tasks
   - Updated file paths and dependencies
2. **Request user approval** with a clear prompt like:
   > "I've completed [specific task]. Should I update IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md to mark this as complete and adjust remaining tasks? Please review the proposed changes carefully."
3. **Wait for explicit approval** - Do NOT auto-approve or assume consent
4. **Commit the documentation update** separately from code changes

## Current Implementation Status (Updated: September 28, 2025 - 9:40 AM)

### 🎆 Major Milestone: OLAM End-to-End Validation Complete

**OLAM is now fully operational** with real PDDL execution:
- ✅ PDDL Environment implemented (replaces MockEnvironment)
- ✅ Java dependency bypass working with PROPER action filtering (fixed September 28)
- ✅ Fluent conversion handles all classical planning domains
- ✅ Rover domain validation successful (100% action success rate after fix)
- ✅ Ready for comparative experiments with other algorithms

### 🔧 Critical Fix Applied (September 28, 2025)
**Fixed OLAM Java Bypass Action Filtering**:
- **Problem**: Java bypass returned empty non-executable list, causing random selection from all 313 actions (90% failure rate)
- **Solution**: Implemented proper action filtering using PDDL environment in bypass mode
- **Result**: Action selection success improved from 10% to 100% in validation tests
- **Branch**: `fix-olam-action-filtering`

- **Python 3.9+** - In conda environment
- **SLURM** - HPC job scheduling (future)

## Implementation Phases

**🎯 CRITICAL UPDATE - Phase Ordering Changed:**

**ENVIRONMENT MUST BE IMPLEMENTED FIRST** - Without a real PDDL environment, we cannot validate OLAM's actual learning. Mock data is insufficient for verification.

**Revised Phase Order:**
1. ✅ Phase 2 (COMPLETED): OLAM adapter with BaseActionModelLearner interface
2. ✅ Phase 3 (COMPLETED): Experiment framework and metrics collection
3. **✅ Phase 3a (COMPLETED September 27, 2025)**: PDDL Environment - Real action execution with precondition checking
4. **⏳ Phase 3b**: Full OLAM validation on Rover domain with real execution
5. **Only after OLAM validation**: Implement other algorithms

**Why Environment First:**
- Current MockEnvironment provides random success/failure - NOT real learning
- Cannot verify OLAM's precondition/effect learning without real state transitions
- Cannot track domain evolution without actual PDDL execution
- Risk of "phantom" learning where we think OLAM works but it's just mock data

### ✅ Phase 2: OLAM Adapter Implementation (Test-Driven Development) - COMPLETED

**Critical Fixes Applied (September 27, 2025):**
1. **Java Dependency Workaround**: OLAM can now run without Java installation using `bypass_java=True`
2. **General Fluent Conversion**: Fixed to handle all classical planning domains, not hardcoded for specific domains
3. **Object Names with Underscores**: Properly handles objects like `high_res`, `low_res` in rover domain

**Context Documentation:**

      - Test model accuracy over time
      - Test compatibility with UP simulator

2. **THEN: Implement OLAM Adapter** (`src/algorithms/olam_adapter.py`)

   **Implementation Requirements:**
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.append('/home/omer/projects/OLAM')
   from OLAM.Learner import Learner
   ```

   - Implement BaseActionModelLearner interface
   - State conversion methods:
     - `_up_state_to_olam(up_state)` → Set of strings
     - `_olam_state_to_up(olam_state)` → UP State
   - Action conversion methods:
     - `_up_action_to_olam(action, objects)` → OLAM format
     - `_olam_action_to_up(action_idx)` → (name, objects)
   - Wrap OLAM methods:
     - `select_action()` → Use OLAM's exploration
     - `observe()` → Call appropriate OLAM learning method
     - `get_learned_model()` → Export OLAM's learned operators
     - `has_converged()` → Check OLAM's convergence flag

3. **Validation Requirements:**

   **All tests must pass before proceeding to experiments:**
   - Unit tests achieve 100% code coverage
   - Integration tests work with at least 3 PDDL domains
   - Edge cases handled gracefully without crashes
   - Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 1s per action)
   - Memory usage stays within bounds
   - OLAM functionality correctly preserved


### Phase 4a: SAT Integration Module Refactoring ⏳ FOUNDATIONAL

**Rationale:** Extract CNF/SAT functionality from core into dedicated modules for better organization and reusability.

**Test-Driven Development Approach:**
1. Write tests for new module structure (`tests/test_sat_integration.py`)
2. Test CNF builder functionality
3. Test SAT solver wrapper

   - Provide fallback for missing dependencies

5. **Update CNF Manager** (`src/core/cnf_manager.py`)
   - Refactor to use new sat_integration modules
   - Maintain existing API for backward compatibility
   - Delegate to specialized modules
   - Keep high-level coordination logic

### Phase 4b: Planning Integration Module ⏳ REQUIRED FOR EXPERIMENTS

**Rationale:** Create dedicated planning module for UP integration and planner management.

**Test-Driven Development Approach:**
1. Write test suite first (`tests/test_planning_integration.py`)
2. Test planner initialization with different backends
3. Test plan generation and validation

   - Handle plan validation with UP's PlanValidator
   - Provide timeout and error handling
   - Convert between internal and UP plan formats
   - Support both optimal and satisficing planning modes

### Phase 3a: PDDL Environment Implementation ⏳ CRITICAL BLOCKER - MUST COMPLETE FIRST

**Rationale:** The PDDL Environment is the CRITICAL missing component preventing real experiments. Without it, we only have mock data and cannot validate OLAM's actual learning behavior. This MUST be implemented before ANY further progress.

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:**
- OLAM internally may compute plans, but `select_action()` returns ONE action at a time
- Our single-action interface is CORRECT - OLAM decomposes plans into individual actions
- Verified: No risk of mistaking plan execution for single action execution

**Test-Driven Development Approach:**
1. Write test suite first (`tests/test_pddl_environment.py`)
2. Test environment initialization with PDDL files
3. Test action execution and state transitions

   - Log state transitions for validation

**Integration with Experiment Runner:**
- Replace MockEnvironment with PDDLEnvironment in runner
- Environment provides REAL action execution for learning loop
- State observations compatible with OLAM adapter format
- Enables full end-to-end testing of OLAM learning

### Phase 3b: OLAM Validation on Rover Domain ⏳ IMMEDIATELY AFTER ENVIRONMENT

**Prerequisites:** Phase 3a (PDDL Environment) MUST be complete

**Validation Requirements:**

   - Compare with ground truth domain

2. **Action Selection Verification**
   - Log WHY each action was chosen (strategy used)
   - Verify exploration vs exploitation balance
   - Ensure no "phantom" successes from mocking

7. Implement algorithm to pass tests incrementally

**Files to create:**
- `tests/test_information_gain.py` - Test suite for algorithm (CREATE FIRST)
- `src/algorithms/information_gain.py` - Main algorithm implementation

**Implementation Requirements:**

1. **Information Gain Learner** (`src/algorithms/information_gain.py`)
   - Initialize with domain using PDDLHandler
   - Maintain 6 knowledge sets per action (pre, pre?, eff+, eff-, eff?+, eff?-)
   - Use CNFManager for precondition constraints (pre?)
   - Handle negative preconditions (¬fluent checks)
   - Calculate information gain metrics:
     - `preAppPotential`: Knowledge from successful preconditions
     - `preFailPotential`: Knowledge from failed preconditions
     - `effPotential`: Knowledge from observed effects
   - Action selection based on expected information gain
   - Update rules for success/failure observations

   from model_learner.ModelLearnerLifted import ModelLearnerLifted
   ```
   - Implement BaseActionModelLearner interface
   - Handle ModelLearner's lifted_dict YAML requirement
   - Key method: `learning_step_all_actions_updated()`
   - Manage optimistic model updates
   - State/action format conversion similar to OLAM adapter
   - Integrate with experiment framework for three-way comparison

### Phase 8: HPC Deployment

**Files to create:**

- `slurm/run_batch.sh`
- `scripts/collect_results.py`

**Requirements:**
1. **SLURM Scripts**
   - Conda environment activation
   - Resource allocation (memory, CPUs, time)
   - Array jobs for multiple experiments
   - Checkpointing and restart capability

2. **Results Collection**

## Key Dependencies

```bash
# Core dependencies
pip install unified-planning[fast-downward,tamer]
pip install python-sat        # PySAT for Minisat
pip install pyeda             # Optional: for Espresso minimization
pip install pyyaml            # Configuration files
pip install pandas matplotlib # Analysis and visualization

# Development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov # Testing
pip install black flake8      # Code formatting
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### Working with Unified Planning Framework

**CRITICAL**: UP uses expression trees (FNode), NOT simple sets!
- Preconditions are List[FNode] that need recursive traversal
- Use `expr.is_and()`, `expr.is_fluent_exp()` etc. to check types
- See `docs/UNIFIED_PLANNING_GUIDE.md` for details

### Handling Negative Preconditions

- Positive literal `clear(a)`: Check if `clear(a) ∈ state`
- Negative literal `¬clear(a)`: Check if `clear(a) ∉ state`
- CNF representation: `¬clear(a)` becomes negated variable `¬x_clear_a`
- See examples in `docs/information_gain_algorithm/INFORMATION_GAIN_ALGORITHM.md`

### Import Paths

```python
# PySAT (handle both package names)
try:
    from pysat.solvers import Minisat22
    from pysat.formula import CNF
except ImportError:
    from pysat.solvers import Minisat22  # python-sat package
    from pysat.formula import CNF

# Unified Planning
from unified_planning.io import PDDLReader
from unified_planning.shortcuts import OneshotPlanner
from unified_planning.engines import SequentialSimulator

# External algorithms (add to sys.path)
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/omer/projects/OLAM')
sys.path.append('/home/omer/projects/ModelLearner/src')
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests** ✅ Completed for:
   - CNF Manager with lifted fluents
   - PDDL Handler with type hierarchy
   - Expression tree traversal

2. **Integration Tests** (Next Priority):
   - Information gain algorithm with CNF
   - Algorithm adapters with UP
   - Environment simulation

3. **System Tests** - Full experiments on domains:
   - Blocksworld (start here)
   - Gripper
   - Logistics

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - SAT solver scaling
   - Formula minimization effectiveness
   - Planning timeouts

## Success Criteria

- ✅ CNF formulas correctly represent uncertainty (with lifted support)
- ✅ Type hierarchy properly handled with 'object' as root
- ✅ OLAM adapter implements BaseActionModelLearner interface
- ⏳ All three algorithms implement BaseActionModelLearner interface (1/3 complete)
- ⏳ Information gain correctly calculated from CNF model counting
- ⏳ Experiments run on standard PDDL domains
- ⏳ Results reproducible with seed control
- ⏳ Metrics show clear algorithm comparison

## Critical Reminders for Next Session

1. **ALWAYS review `docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` first**
2. **Check `CLAUDE.md` for quick context guidance**
3. **Follow Test-Driven Development** - Write tests before implementation
4. **UP uses expression trees** - Never assume simple sets
5. **Negative preconditions** need special handling
6. **Test incrementally** - Start with blocksworld, 3-4 objects
7. **Use existing implementations** - CNFManager and PDDLHandler are complete
8. **Complete OLAM testing** before implementing other algorithms

## Next Steps Priority Order

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE CRITICAL PATH:

1. **PDDL Environment Implementation (Phase 3a) - BLOCKING ALL PROGRESS:**
   - Write test suite first (`tests/test_pddl_environment.py`)
   - Implement `src/environments/pddl_environment.py` with UP's SequentialSimulator
   - Replace MockEnvironment in experiment runner
   - Verify real PDDL execution (no mocks!)
   - **Cannot proceed without this component**

2. **OLAM Validation on Rover (Phase 3b) - Immediately after environment:**
   - Run full 300-iteration experiment on Rover domain
   - Log domain evolution every 10-20 actions
   - Track action selection strategies
   - Verify actual learning (not mock successes)
   - Generate evidence of correct OLAM behavior
   - **MILESTONE: Establish verified OLAM baseline**

3. **Only After OLAM Validation:**
   - Information-Theoretic Algorithm (Phase 4)
   - ModelLearner Adapter (Phase 5)
   - Three-way algorithm comparison

### Why This Order is Mandatory:
- **Current state**: We have NO real PDDL execution, only mocks
- **Risk**: We might think OLAM works but it's just random mock data
- **Solution**: Implement environment FIRST, validate OLAM SECOND, then continue
